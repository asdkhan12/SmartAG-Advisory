# Smart Agriculture Advisory

# By Asad Khan and Minh Nyguen 

The Smart Agriculture Advisory System is a responsive, web-based dashboard designed to empower small scale farmers with precise, real time weather insights and actionable farming recommendations. By integrating the Weatherstack API as well as WeatherAPI, the platform displays up to the minute data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation and 7-day forecasts. It then generates tailored irrigation schedules, planting/harvest advisories, and extreme weather alerts helping farmers optimize water use, plan fieldwork, and mitigate climate related risks



# Target Browsers
Built with Bootstrap and Reactâ€™s component-based architecture, the front end is fully responsive and mobile friendly. It supports all modern desktop browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, plus mobile browsers such as Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android, ensuring farmers can access the advisory dashboard from smartphones, tablets or desktops alike.
